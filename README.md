# Adopt-a-Owner

## Description

As someone who has been looking to adopt a pet, I have had to navigate through multiple websites and applications all to end up not being able to adopt. 

- This project was created to minimize the number of applications an adopter has to fill and to hopefully rescue some pets from being euthanized. We learned how to difficult it can be to actually adopt and rescue a pet from the amount of forms that are needed, the applications and dealing with multiple shelters, adoption and rescue centers/
